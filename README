					Pigale Installation

Pigale uses GNU autocconfig for compilation and installation.

1/ Run the configure script
./configure [options]

By default, the prefix for installation is /usr/local/pigale.
If you do'nt have a write permission, you must provide  another directory where you have a write permission
./configure --prefix=/home/adirectory.
Usually the location of the installation of Qt is defined by the environement variable QTDIR.
For more options run "./configure --help" . These otions, in particular, let you enable a debug mode, let you precise the locations of the Qt libraries, etc.

2/ Next run the following commands
make
make install

The programs are installed in xx/bin, the libraries in xx/lib and some documentation in xx/Doc.

 14/01/2005: Now the partition algorithm recolor the vertices between 1 and 16 (previously 0-15) and the colors  names are diplayed in the message window.
 14/01/2005: added an algorithm to color connected components:
		int TopologicalGraph::ColorConnectedComponents().
14/01/2005: Corrected a bug occurring while forcing the computation of the map of a tree.
04/02/2005: Corrected a bug occurring while drawing a not connected bipartite graph by contact of segments.
04/02/2005: Dual graphs  and angle graphs are only computed for connected planar graphs.
10/02/2005: Improved ClientServer programs
11/02/2005: Added an algoritm to make a graph connected by adding vertices:
		int TopologicalGraph::MakeConnectedVertex().
11/02/2005: Added an algoritm to make a graph biconnected by adding vertices:
		int TopologicalGraph::NpBiconnectVertex()
11/02/2005: So now, triangulate by adding vertices and quandrangulate a graph by adding vertices work properly.	
18/02/2005: The vision algorithm does not anymore compute a biporlar orientation if the graph is already biporlarly oriented.

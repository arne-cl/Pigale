    <P>
      We develop a
      <b>graph editor</b> and a <b>C++ </b>algorithm library essentially concerned with planar
      graphs. The editor is particularly intended for graph theoretical research.  
      <br>
      Pigale is available under the <B>GPL</B> <A HREF="license.html">License</A>.
      and can be obtained either by ftp or cvs:

    <P>
      It is built over a new graph data structure optimizing
      topological operations on static graphs 
      <!-- (5 to 10 speed up of basic algorithms) -->.

      on recent theoretical researches of our site.

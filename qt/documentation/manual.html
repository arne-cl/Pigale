<h3>Starting Pigale</h3>
The environement variable TGF should point to a repertory <tt>tgf</tt> which contains
graphs coded either as <A HREF="manual.html#tgf"><b>tgf</b></A> files or 
<A HREF="manual.html#tgf"><b>ascii</b></A> files.
When  <b>Pigale</b> is started,the file <tt>a.tgf</tt> is opened for reading and writing.
And the first graph is loaded and displayed.<br>
While in the graph editor,the arrows of the toolbar let you load the next
 or previous graph of the current tgf file:<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td><IMG SRC="../icones/sleft.xpm"></td>
<td><IMG SRC="../icones/reload.xpm"></td>
<td><IMG SRC="../icones/sright.xpm"></td>
</tr>
</table>
On the lowest band of the main window is displayed the current tgf input and output file.<br>

In Pigale there always one active graph which is displayed in the <b>Graph editor</b> window.
That graph can be saved, modified or displayed by different
algoritms. A copy is created for any display not in the <b>Graph editor</b> window.

<h3>Windows</h3>
Under the menus, there is a toolbar that you can move around or hide.<br>
Notice that some menus are not availaible if the current graph does 
fulfill the right properties for a given algorithm.<br>

If you see a small manual " <IMG SRC="../icones/xman.xpm" > " at the left of a menu item,
 you can get a small help using the WhatisThis button <IMG SRC="../icones/help.xpm" ><br>
The windows next, to the <b>Graph editor</b> window, are used to show 
different views of a graph and these few notes.<br>
The top right window is for messages (properties of the graph, warnings,etc).
Just under are displayed the main properties of the graph, all of them are maintained
in real time.

<h3>Pigale settings</h3>
Among other things, the <b>Settings</b> menu allows you to:
<ul>
<li> be in <b>debug</b> mode to increase the verbosity of Pigale and print more messages in <tt>log.txt</tt>
<li> enable or disable the <A HREF="#undo"><b>undo</b></A> feature
<li> define the <b>Pigale colors</b> used by Pigale. These colors are save in a file <tt>settings.txt</tt>.
To come back to the original colors, you only need to erase that file
<li> define the <b>limits</b> of pigale: i.e. define the maximum number of vertices above which graph are not displayed and slow algorithms are not performed.
<li>define what the <b>vertex show</b> i.e. their labels or their index (or whateve the user programmed).
<li> define some <b>embed options</b>, now for Schnyder drawings.
<li> define the <b>distance</b> used to embed the grah in <b>R<sup>n-1</sup></b>
</ul>
The dashed line at the top of the settings menu, is used to create a floating settings menu.

<h3>Mouse Actions </h3>
By default, the <b>left button</b> of the mouse is use to move vertices.<br>
Other actions can be selected, by clicking on the radion buttons (Left Button).<br>
If the <b>shift</b> is pressed, the actions are toggled the following way:
<ul>
<li> Add <b>\</b> Del </li>
<li> Move a vertex <b>\</b> Move all vertices of a given colour </li>
<li> Bissection <b>\</b> Contraction </li>
</ul>
Other actions:
<ul>
<li> <b>Add  + control lef button </b> Duplicate the coloured subgraph </li>
<li> <b>Add  + shift control lef button </b> Duplicate the coloured subgraph 
				    and add edges between corresponding vertices</li>
<!-- <li> The <b>move control first button</b> zoom in.</li>
<li> The <b>move shift control first button</b> zoom out.</li> -->
<li> The <b>middle button</b> is set to move vertices.</li>
<li> The <b>right button</b> is set to display some information.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Colours and Thickness</h3>
The 16 upper small coloured squares at the right of the editing window, 
defines the brush color which appears whith a bigger square. <br>
The brush color defines the color of the vertices 
when they are created, recolored or define the ones to be deleted.<br>
The 16 lower sqares have the same functionnality for edges.<br>
The last 3 squares are used to define the thickness of the edges.


<h3> Drawing on a grid</h3>
The grid size is defined by the slider position.<br>
When a graph is loaded, Pigale computes the minimum size on which the graph can be drawn, without
moving the vertices.
When you click on <b> Force G</b>, Pigale will force all the vertices to fall on grid points,
checking overlapping of vertices and checking, only if the graph is connected,
 that the genus did change. 
The <b>undo G</b> button, let you come back to the previous state.
When you click on <b>Fit grid</b>, you are only enable to
move or create vertices on grid points.

<h3> <A NAME="undo"> Undo/Redo</A></h3>
If this function is enable, a copy of the current graph is appended each time a program
(except the editor) adds or delete edges. All the copies are destroyed when a new graph is loaded.<br>
The save icon let you manually append a copy.

There is no limit of the number of copies which are placed in the tgf file undo.tgf.

<ul>
<li><b>Left button:</b>

  <li>Moving along X axis -&gt; Rotate along Y
  <li>Moving along Y axis -&gt; Rotate along X
  <li>Double Click -&gt; Start/Stop Rotate (depends on vertical slider)

 <li><b>Middle Button:</b>

<H3>Buttons</H3>
The rightmost spin boxes let you select the projection to display.
The <b>facet</b> button triangulate the graph, if it is planar, and draw the facets.<br>
If you have no mouse wheel, you can use the keyboard <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> arrows to zoom,
provided you have clicked on the drawing.

<HR><H2> <A NAME="tgf">T</A>gf and ASCII files </H2> 
We use a general proprietary format <b>TGF</b>.<br> 
A TGF file contains records, here corresponding to graphs.
Each record consisting of a variable number of fields.<br>
One of its main advantage is that we can write and read any complex data structure.
But it is dependent of the processor type (Low or High indian etc).<br><br>
We use very simple <b>ASCII</b> files to store graphs. <br>
For example, the following file defines a graph called <tt>Triangle</tt> 
with three vertices labelled <tt>10,20,30</tt>
and three edges. The last line indicates the end of file.
<tt><br>
Triangle<br>
10 20<br>
20 30<br>
30 10<br>
0 0
</tt>
